## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**
- Provide a seamless and intuitive e-commerce experience for staff to browse and purchase preloved devices.
- Empower site owners to manage the store's inventory and keep track of staff purchases.

**Primary User Needs**
- Guest users need to browse products and checkout with ease.
- Registered customers need a streamlined shopping experience with profile features.
- Site owners need to be able to access the admin panel with ease.

**Business Goals**
- Drive sales by providing a user-friendly shopping experience.
- Maintain an organized and up-to-date store inventory.

#### 2. Scope

**[Features](#features)** (see below)

**Content Requirements**
- Product details, including name, price, description, and images.
- Clear prompts and instructions for browsing and purchasing.
- Order details, confirmation pages, and email notifications.
- Secure payment processing using Stripe.
- Payment success emails shown to users.
- 404 page for lost users.

#### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Links to Home and Account sections.

**User Flow**
1. Guest user browses the store and naviagates selection of avialable devices.  
2. Guest user selects buy now to make a quick one time purchase.  
3. Guest user creates an account or logs in during checkout → completes purchase.  
5. Site owners manage inventory → add, update, or delete products and categories.  
6. Users signup to the newsletter → potentially receive advanced notice of upcoming sales. 

#### 4. Skeleton

**[Wireframes](#wireframes)** (see below)

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#3772FF` primary highlights.
- `#DF2935` secondary text.
- `#FDCA40` secondary highlights.

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Product {
        CharField name
        CharField brand
        CharField grade
        PositiveIntegerField storage_gb
        DecimalField camera_megapixels
        DecimalField price
        URLField image_url
        TextField description
    }

    Order {
        CharField stripe_payment_id
        DecimalField price_paid
        DateTimeField created_at
    }

    CustomerProfile {
        CharField phone_number
        TextField address
        CharField department
    }

    User ||--o{ Order : places

## Agile Development Process

### Trello Board


[Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/67a746f8f9a7808b12a88f1c/ATTIfa1ebcb41c5079925a9aa3d7b0ea536a37ED484C/project-5-code-institute) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the trello cards and lists.

![screenshot](documentation/features/trello.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a **Business to Customer** model. It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business internally, and boost site visitor awarness in the business, especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users. For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## SEO & Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine. This included a series of the following keyword types:

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file. This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://project5megansaenz-c4f7a29ca180.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml), which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level. Inside, I've included the default settings:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://project5megansaenz-c4f7a29ca180.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales. Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a mockFacebook business account using the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?viewas=100000686899395&id=61576233850068).

![screenshot](documentation/features/mockup-facebook.png)
![screenshot](documentation/features/facebooksite.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application using Formspree, to allow users to supply their email address if they are interested in learning more. 

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://project5megansaenz-c4f7a29ca180.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user-inserts-own-gmail-api-key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://project5megansaenz-c4f7a29ca180.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (*verify your password and account*)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords** (*search for it at the top, if not*).
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
    - Any custom name, such as "Django" or `project5`
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
    - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
    - If your 16-character password contains *spaces*, make sure to remove them entirely.
    - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
    - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/MaejorS/project5).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files.
3. Select whether you prefer to clone using "HTTPS", "SSH", or "GitHub CLI", and click the "copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open "Git Bash" or "Terminal".
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:
	- `git clone https://www.github.com/MaejorS/project5.git`
7. Press "Enter" to create your local clone.

**Please Note**: in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you should have the browser extension installed. A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/MaejorS/project5).
2. At the top of the Repository, just below the "Settings" button on the menu, locate and click the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
